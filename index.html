      <p>The shoebill also known as the whalebill, whale-headed stork or shoe-billed stork, is a very large long-legged
        wading bird.
        <strong>It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped bill</strong>.

      <h2>The Shoebill Moos?</h2>
      <p>The shoebill is normally silent, but they perform bill-clattering displays at the nest.
        When engaging in these displays, adult birds have also been noted to utter a cow-like moo as well as
        high-pitched whines.
        Both nestlings and adults engage in bill-clattering during the nesting season as a means of communication.
        When young are begging for food, they call out with a sound uncannily like human hiccups.

    <h2>The Status of the Shoebill</h2>
    <p>The population is estimated at between 5,000 and 8,000 individuals,
      the majority of which live in swamps in South Sudan, Uganda, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia.
      BirdLife International has classified it as <em>Vulnerable</em> with the main threats being habitat destruction,
      disturbance and hunting.
